-  User story;

   - When I select the birthday, I can calculate my exact age as years, months, days, hours, seconds, minutes.
   - After calculation of age, the background image will be changed and age countdown should be continued(internal).
   - If I select a date after today, the page should warn me about it.

ðŸ”¥ You donâ€™t need to create a new html template in this project, you can use this template. We will be concerned in javascript side.
